##  Password Cracking Time (Estimated by Brute Force Attack)

This table shows approximate cracking times for various types of passwords using brute force attacks. Use this as a guide to create stronger, more secure passwords.

| Password Type                    | Example             | Estimated Crack Time     |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| Only numbers (6 characters)      | `123456`             | < 1 second                |
| Only letters (6 characters)      | `monkey`             | < 1 second                |
| Letters + numbers                | `abc123`             | < 1 second                |
| Letters + numbers + symbols (6)  | `P@ss12`             | < 1 second                |
| Mixed (9 characters)             | `P@ssw0rd!`          | Few hours                 |
| Complex mix (9 characters)       | `A1b2C3d4!`          | Few days                  |
| Complex mix (11 characters)      | `L!8xR#5qV&7`        | Thousands of years        |
| Passphrase (25+ characters)      | `CorrectHorseBatteryStaple` | Billions of years |

### Password Security Tips

- Use **at least 12 characters**.
- Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
- Avoid using common words, names, or predictable patterns (`123456`, `qwerty`, `password`).
- Consider using **a secure passphrase** like: `Sun$Light#Run!Cloud98`.
- Use a **password manager** to store and generate strong passwords.
